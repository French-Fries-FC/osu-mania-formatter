# osu-mania-formatter
A simple python program for the formatting of the skin.ini (the "skini") file for mania so things are a bit less tedious, at least for me

Running this program will create an output folder in the location of the .py file. This folder will contain the formatted skin.ini, so just copy and paste the new format into your existing skin.ini. (The one in your osu! skin)

When prompted, insert no values to ignore.

And if you want to download it, just check [releases](https://github.com/French-Fries-FC/osu-mania-formatter/releases)

Expected to change and add features :3
